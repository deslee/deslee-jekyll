## Projects
Here are a few of my projects. I work on them whenever I have time.

- [Elevator Simulator]({{ site.relative }}projects/elevator-simulator.html) - An elevator simulator written in JavaScript
- [Numeric converter]({{ site.relative }}projects/binary-decimal-converter.html) - Currently only a binary/decimal converter
- [DesCms](http://github.com/deslee/descms) - A barebones cms written in [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
