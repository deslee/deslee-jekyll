## About me

My name is Desmond Lee. I am an undergraduate Software Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I have a strong interest in web development, Unix based systems, and artificial intelligence / machine learning.

## Current work

I am currently interning at [Captured Dimensions][1], a company specializing in 3D printing and scanning. I am currently working on an internal [Django][2] web suite as well as a [Qt][3]/[PySide][4] thick client interface.

## Interests

#### Web development

I am currently interested in using [Flask][5] for web development. Like Django, Flask is a powerful web framework. Flask is more lightweight than Django, and can more easily integrate with other third party middleware. With FLask, I want to create a customized personal content management system, as well as an art/photography portfolio manager.

#### Linux home system

I want to create a useful [homelab][6], using a [Raspberry Pi][7] that I purchased for $40. My current homelab alraedy makes my life easier by providing a number of services:

- Stores and serves movies / music
- Runs a [Transmission][8] server
- Persistently syncs to Google Play Music, allowing me to access my music anywhere
- Establishes an ssh tunnel to my vps, allowing me to start / manage downloads away from home
- Runs a [BTSync][9] client for peer to peer file synchronization
